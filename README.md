Woe to William

there once was a teacher;
whose deadlines would teeter;
from friday to monday;
oh students did cheer;

on a fair day in june;
did she release the ISU;
"how long would it be?";
in two weeks it was due;

// why'd the rhyme scheme change
in some sparked excitement;
and others, despair;
but a const was set for all; //???
stress was in the air;

// why'd the rhyme scheme change back
"'tis a deadline so far!",
-said self-declared stars,
who worked on other projects.
(quite dead they now are).
